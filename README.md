# Kimo Organization

Kimo is an early–childhood learning platform designed to help children ages 3–5 understand emotions through storytelling and interactive play. The organization hosts repositories that power the Kimo ecosystem, including mobile applications and documentation.

## 🎯 Mission

Kimo aims to support parents in teaching emotional intelligence—an abstract and complex concept—through structured frameworks such as **RULER** (Recognize, Understand, Label, Express, Regulate). Our goal is to create tools that strengthen emotional learning and parent–child bonding.

## 🏛 Repository Structure

The organization may contain (but is not limited to) the following repositories:

* **kimo-ios** — iOS application built with SwiftUI
  
*(Adjust this list as the organization evolves.)*

## 📄 Policies

Refer to **`POLICY.md`** — the central document containing guidelines for:
* Privacy commitments and how user data is handled within our apps  
* Required permissions and how on-device processing is used  
* Security practices and expectations for all repositories  
* Release and submission requirements related to App Store Connect  
* Documentation standards for project-level and organization-level artifacts
